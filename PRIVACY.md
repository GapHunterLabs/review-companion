# Privacy Policy — Review Companion

**Effective date:** 2026-10-06

Review Companion is a Gap Hunter Labs plugin for IntelliJ Platform IDEs.
This policy is short because the plugin's design makes it short: there
is nothing to disclose beyond what's below.

## What this plugin collects

**Nothing.** Review Companion does not collect, transmit, or sell
any data — no source code, no file contents, no usage analytics, no
telemetry, no crash reports, no personally identifiable information.

## What it keeps on your machine

To decide when to show its one-time rating prompt, the plugin keeps two values
in the IDE's own settings on your computer: whether you have answered the
prompt, and a list of up to 500 findings it has already counted. Until the
next release, each entry in that list is the file path and line of a finding,
sometimes with its message. From the next release on, each entry is a one-way
fingerprint that cannot be turned back into a path, and the old list is
deleted. None of this is ever sent anywhere.

Settings you change for the plugin are saved in the IDE's settings, like any
other IDE setting, and are never sent anywhere.

## Network access

**None.** Review Companion makes zero network calls during normal
operation. Every check, detection, and analysis it performs runs
entirely in-process, inside your IDE, against the code already open in
your editor. Nothing you write, open, or edit is ever sent anywhere.

## Third parties

None. Review Companion has no third-party SDKs, no analytics libraries,
no ad networks, no external dependencies that phone home.

## Changes to this policy

If this ever changes, this file will be updated and the change will be
noted in the plugin's `CHANGELOG.md`.
